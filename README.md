### Project Solution:
The production of blue hydrogen entails extracting hydrogen from natural gas via a method known as steam methane reforming (SMR). During this method, natural gas, primarily composed of methane, interacts with steam at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. To classify this process as "blue," the generated carbon dioxide is captured and stored through carbon capture and storage (CCS), preventing its release into the atmosphere. To be in the general range, 75 to 90% of the CO2 in the inlet gas stream is successfully captured. To enhance the recovery rate, modifications to the column dimensions and energy consumption would be necessary, which could result in significantly higher expenses.

### General Problems:
Cyclic Capacity: The solvent's capacity to absorb CO₂ diminishes over time due to factors such as chemical degradation, contamination, or a decline in effectiveness. Cyclic capacity indicates the solvent's performance across multiple absorption and regeneration cycles. Enhancements in cyclic capacity are essential for maintaining effective CO₂ capture over longer durations.
Solvent Loss: Loss of solvent can happen through evaporation, degradation, or leaks. This not only hampers the efficiency of the CO₂ capture process but also raises operational expenses due to the necessity for solvent replacement and the disposal of degraded solvent.

### Costly/Not Too Efficient Solutions:
Column Size: Enlarging the absorption and stripping columns is essential for boosting CO2 recovery rates. While bigger columns can enhance CO2 capture, the downside is the rise in capital and operational expenses.
Energy Usage: Achieving higher recovery rates demands additional energy for tasks such as solvent regeneration or CO2 desorption. This uptick in operational costs can hamper the overall efficiency of the process.

### Efficient Solutions: Making use of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and AI algorithms (in this case, Predictive Modelling) to:
Improve the cyclic capacity of the solvent: Leading to increased efficiency and cost reduction, in addition to optimizing molecular modeling and data analysis and optimization
Reduce solvent loss: Leading to economy efficiency and decrease in environmental contamination, in addition to understanding molecular dynamics and undergoing monitoring and control
These two solutions possess the potential to reduce capital and operational costs in the long run.
